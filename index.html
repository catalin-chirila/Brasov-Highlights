            <p>Fringed by the peaks of the Southern Carpathian Mountains and resplendent with gothic,
                baroque and renaissance architecture, as well as a wealth of historical attractions,
                Brasov is one of the most visited places in Romania.
            </p>
            <p>Founded by the Teutonic Knights in 1211 on an ancient Dacian site and settled by the Saxons as
                one of the seven walled citadels, Brasov exudes a distinct medieval ambiance and has been used
                as backdrop in many recent period films.

                The Saxons built massive stone walls and seven bastions around the city that are still visible today,
                as well as ornate churches, elaborately trimmed buildings and one of the finest central squares in the
                country, said to be the spot to which the legendary Pied Piper led the children of Hamlin. Located at
                the heart of old medieval Brasov and lined with beautiful red-roofed merchant houses, the Council Square,
                known to the Saxon population as the Marktplatz, is a nice place to rest and soak in the beautiful scenery.

            <p>
                Built between 1385 and 1477 on the site of an earlier church (destroyed by Mongol invasions in 1242),
                the construction of the Marienkirche, as it was known in German, was hampered by extensive damage
                caused by Turkish raids in 1421. The church was given its new name after disaster struck again in 1689, when the Great Fire leveled most
                of the town, blackening the walls of the church. Restoration took almost 100 years. Of two towers planned, only one was finished.

            <p>
                Ever since Saxon settlers arrived in the early 12th century, invading Mongols, Turks and others gave
                them a tough time, repeatedly destroying the old settlements of Bartholoma and Corona. Thereafter,
                the Saxons set themselves to building fortifications around their town.

                Most work was done between 1400 and 1650, when outer and inner walls were erected,
                together with massive defense towers and gates. Part of the defensive wall, once 40 feet high,
                seven feet thick and two miles long, can still be seen today, though most was taken down in the 19th century to make room for the city's expansion.

            <p>
                Catherine's Gate, erected in 1559 by the Tailors' Guild, is the only original gate to have survived
                from medieval times. The fairy-tale tower we see today was part of a bigger structure, which unfortunately,
                was demolished in 1827. The original structure can be seen at the Weavers' Bastion Museum where a
                large model of 16th century Brasov is displayed. The four small corner turrets (as seen in other Saxon citadels)
                symbolized the judicial autonomy of the Town Council which could apply, if necessary, the death penalty.
                Above the entrance, the tower bears the city's coat of arms: a crown on a tree trunk.

            <p>
                During the Saxon rule of Brasov, from the 13th to the 17th century, Romanians were forbidden from
                owning property inside the citadel walls and so they settled in the southwestern Schei district.
                Romanians could only enter the town at certain times and had to pay a toll at the gate for the privilege
                of selling their produce inside the citadel. Walk up Strada Prundului to Piata Unirii and the beautiful
                St. Nicholas Church then, wander around the small curving streets that gradually slope upwards against
                the hill.

                Saint Nicholas' Church dominates the Schei District. First built in wood in 1392,
                replaced with a stone structure in 1495 and considerably expanded in the 18th century,
                the church is a true architectural masterpiece.

                With a mix of Byzantine, baroque and gothic styles,

                Brasov is often referred to as the city at the foot of Mount Tampa.
                Above the Weavers' Bastion, along the southeastern side of the fortress walls,
                there is an alley (Aleea Tiberiu Brediceanu), shaded by old trees and dotted with benches.
                From here, one can hike to the top of Tampa Mountain, where the original defensive fortress was built.

                The museum also displays works by Brasov-born Janos Mattis-Teutsch (1884-1960), one of the most influential
